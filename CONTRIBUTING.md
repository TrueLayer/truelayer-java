# Contributing to TrueLayer Java
We aim to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code or proposing a new feature
- Submitting code changes
- Proposing new features

## Bug reports
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Before opening a new issue, please make 
sure that similar ones are not there already.

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TrueLayer/truelayer-java/issues/new); 

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Library version and environment information, as well as other relevant notes

## Discussions
We use the [discussion](https://github.com/TrueLayer/truelayer-java/discussions) section to talk about the current state of the project as well as 
to propose new features.
