# TrueLayer Java

[![License](https://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)](https://truelayer.mit-license.org/)


The official [TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com) Java client provides convenient access to TrueLayer APIs from applications built with Java. 

The library currently targets Java 11.

## Installation


### Pre-release Packages


## Documentation

For a comprehensive list of examples, check out the [API documentation](https://docs.truelayer.com).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

First [sign up](https://console.truelayer.com/) for a developer account. Follow the instructions to set up a new application and obtain your Client ID and Secret. Once the application has been created you must add your application redirected URIs in order to test your integration end-to-end. 

Next, generate a signing key pair used to sign API requests.

To generate a private key, run:

```sh
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/out -w /out -it alpine/openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp521r1 -noout -out ec512-private-key.pem
```

To obtain the public key, run:

```sh
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/out -w /out -it alpine/openssl ec -in ec512-private-key.pem -pubout -out ec512-public-key.pem
```
